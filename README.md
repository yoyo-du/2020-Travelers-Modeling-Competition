# 2020-Travelers-Modeling-Competition

### Project Description
You work for InsNova Auto Insurance Company, an Australian company. Your business partner, who is not familiar with statistics at all, would like you to create a rating plan based on the historical auto claim data. Your business partner is concerned about segmentation as well as competitiveness, as there are several other competitors in the market.

For this case competition, your groupâ€™s task is to provide a method for predicting the claim cost for each policy and to convince your business partner that your predictions will work well.

### Model Evaluation and Competition Logistics
The model will be evaluated using the Gini index. We will calculate your score once you submit your result.

The teams scoring better than the benchmark will move on to the second stage, the virtual live presentations. Each qualifying team will give a 5-7 minute presentation on the above questions followed by a 3 minute Q&A session. The top teams will be eligible for consideration as the overall campus winner.

The winning campus team will join other winning teams for a virtual job shadow day at Travelers and make final presentations to a panel who will determine the ultimate winner!
