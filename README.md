### Project Description
You work for InsNova Auto Insurance Company, an Australian company. Your business partner, who is not familiar with statistics at all, would like you to create a rating plan based on the historical auto claim data. Your business partner is concerned about segmentation as well as competitiveness, as there are several other competitors in the market.

For this case competition, your groupâ€™s task is to provide a method for predicting the claim cost for each policy and to convince your business partner that your predictions will work well. The model is evaluated using the Gini index.

### Method and Result
We did research on models that are popular in the insurance industry, and finally decided to use the [TDboost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TDboost/TDboost.pdf) in R to fit a Gradient Tree-Boosted Tweedie Compound Poisson model. Our team is selected as one of the winning teams based on the model performance and the presentation on business findings.
